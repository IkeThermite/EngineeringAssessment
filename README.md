A containerized Nameko service that provides three simple functions.

Our journey so far...

**Development Environment Setup:**
 
 1. Installed Virtual Box.
 2. Created a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 20.20.
 3. Installed `python3.6` globally by adding `deadsnakes` repository to system sources.
 4. Installed `pip` and `pipenv`.
 5. Installed `git` and Visual Studio Code.
    - Added the Python extension to VS Code.
 6. Created this repository on GitHub and cloned it to a local drive of the Virtual Machine.
 7. Created a `pipenv` virtual environment to use `python3.6`.
 8. Added the Pipfile, committed and pushed.
    - This needed a personal access token, since I have 2FA on my GitHub account.
